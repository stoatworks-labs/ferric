/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    The fleet's usual small `diag`: a log file and nothing else. No crash
    handler -- a plugin loaded into Resolume has no business installing a
    process-wide signal handler and intercepting faults that are not its own --
    and no diagnostics bundle, because an effect is a list of sliders in
    somebody else's inspector and there is no UI to hang one off.

    What it covers is the failure that actually happens: `InitGL` returning
    `FF_FAIL` because a shader would not compile. From the operator's side that
    is "the effect does nothing", with no message anywhere. Ferric has four
    shader programs and two of them are assembled at runtime from several
    strings -- so any line number the driver reports refers to a file that does
    not exist, and the log has to say *which program*, with the GL vendor and
    version next to it, because that is almost always the reason.

    It also records the host clock's unit at frame sixty. See Ferric.h: the
    difference between a host sending seconds and one sending milliseconds is
    invisible offline and total in a real host.
